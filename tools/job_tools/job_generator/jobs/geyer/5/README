- No steplength control
- Torque soft limit minimization
- muscle noise (+)
- steplengthcontrol (-)
- no trunk_mean_angle (/)
- no trunk_mean_angle + muscle noise (\)
- steplengthcontrol + muscle noise (!)

FIND A 1.3 m/s gait
-------------------
	1.db : optimization without initial population
	2.db : optimization with initial population
	3.db : optimization with initial population + steplength control 
	4.db : optimization with initial population + noise in the muscle
	5.db : optimization with initial population + noise in the muscle
	6.db : optimization with initial population + noise in the muscle
	7.db : optimization with initial population + noise in the muscle
	8.db : optimization with initial population + steplength control 
	9.db : optimization with initial population + steplength control 
	10.db : optimization with initial population + steplength control 

MEMO
----

If we optimize with CMAES for different speed in the same optimization process
then we will find the local direction that maximizes the chance of finding different speed
