Optimization details
====================
- Experiment : FBL
- Initial population : ON (1.3)
- Optimization with full muscle energy model
- No steplength control
- Torque soft limit minimization
- Minimzation of sign changes in knee angle.
- muscle noise (+)
- steplengthcontrol (-)
- no trunk_mean_angle (/)
- no trunk_mean_angle + muscle noise (\)
- steplengthcontrol + muscle noise (!)
- steplengthcontrol rule : 0.4+0.8*x (') (changed rule : 0.8*(0.4+0.8*x), original rule : 0.46+0.8*x
- range changed (*)
- stage order changed (Â´)
- initial population off ([)
- stance based on hdist removed (`)

		--> changed range of hamhf_wl, deltas

MEMO
----

If we optimize with CMAES for different speed in the same optimization process
then we will find the local direction that maximizes the chance of finding different speed
